Tests: View Transaction History

    Test1: View transaction of user with a transaction history

        Expected results: Checking if it is possible to view transaction history of a user, showing the recent transactions done. 

        1 - Login with registered credentials -  User: Heath93 / P: s3cret

        2 - Confirm you are in the Main Page

        3 - Click “Mine” to see my transactions

        4 - Click on the last transaction done

        5 - Check if the last amount transfered is there “100”

        6 - Check if there is the name of the friend with which you did the last transaction

        Final results: I didn't find a way to assure that the transaction found is the right one.


    Test2: View transaction of user with no transaction history

        Expected results: Try to see a transaction history in a user which has no transactions done. Check if the system shows some error or message advising there’s no history.

        1 - Login with user that has no transaction history:
        To make sure I would find a user with no transactions' history, I created a new user, logged in, checked the transaction page and made sure the sign "No Transactions" was shown. I was tested if a "Transaction List would appear", but it didn't, so test was successfull.

        2 - Created a new user: Joao Carlos / username: 'joaocarlos'; password: 'test1'

        3 - Access 'mine' to check my transactions

        4 - Make sure the message 'No transaction' appear

        Final results: The app asks for a Bank Account. We can create it using general name and routing number. After that, we can access the page 'Mine' to show my transaction, and prove that the sentence 'No Transactions' appears.
